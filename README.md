This is the week 4 assignment for the ITP class Dynamic Web Development.<br />

This week, the assignment was to leap into the world of server-side programming with Node.js/Express.js.

* Write server-side JavaScript to create an API that accepts AJAX request coming from a client-side web application to create, read, update, and delete data that are living on the server.

I decided to create a simple chat room application that everyone can use.

Here's the [Live Demo on Glitch](https://cuinjune-chat-room.glitch.me/)
